# **Accessibility**

I wanted to ensure that the website was fully accessible. I have done this by doing the following:

* Providing Alternative Text (Alt Text)
  * I've made sure to add descriptive alternative text (alt text) to all images on the website. Alt text adds context to images, enabling users who rely on screen readers to understand the visual content even if they can't see it.
* Ensuring Color Contrast
  * I've chosen color combinations that maintain accessible contrast ratios, ensuring that text remains readable against different background colors. This benefits users with visual impairments or color blindness.
* Responsive Design
  * The site is designed to adapt to various devices and screen sizes. This caters to users who rely on different devices or have specific accessibility requirements.

# Testing

I performed manual testing all through the creation of my website. I would test to ensure full functionaility is present across all devices before committing any changes.

Below is an overview of my testing and tests were carried out on the following devices:

* Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra
* iPhone 14
* Samsung Galaxy Tab
* ASUS Chromebook with 15.3" Screen
* Windows 11 desktop computer with a 27" Monitor

## Validation and Tools

### W3C Validation Tools

Once my pages were complete I used [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure my code had no errors.

No errors are present throughout the whole site.

I also used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure my code has no CSS errors. This came back as a pass, However there are a number of errors with the fontawesome and materialise which are unavoidable.

Lastly I used [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to validate my JavaScript.

There were no errors found. There was 1 warning to say I had an unused variable but this will be used in future interations of this site.

### Responsiveness Testing

I used [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to ensure my page displayed correctly on all devices. The screenshots are above each pages section
